# BASICS OF R PROGRAMMING

## Data COllection

### Checking and setting Working Directory
```{r}
#Get the working directory
print(getwd())

setwd("C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/WIE2003/dataset/")

print(getwd())
```

### Analyzing Data
Check read and find maximum Critic Score
```{r}
#get maximum critic score
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/WIE2003/dataset/Movies.csv")
criticmax <- max(data$Critic.Score)
print(criticmax)
```

Get movie that have runtime more than 60
```{r}
#Get movie that have runtime more than 60
adata <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/WIE2003/dataset/Movies.csv")
info <- subset(adata,Runtime > 200)
print(info)
```

Get movie that was release in 2000 that has critic score > 70
```{r}
#Get movie that was release in 2000 that has critic score > 70
bdata <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/WIE2003/dataset/Movies.csv")
info <- subset(bdata,Critic.Score > 70 & Year == 2000)
print(info)
```
